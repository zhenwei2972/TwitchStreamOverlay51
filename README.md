# TwitchStreamOverlay51
Experiemental Twitch Stream Overlay game. Loosely based around the "raid area 51" meme

Hey guys, so I may have gone overboard with the joke and built a shitty recreation of area 51. thinking of releasing it to the general public as a multiplayer game where yall run around and storm the area as one contiguous hoard, yall have to coordinate yourself though.

so far I've yet to balance it out yet, not sure if u can actually overcome the security, but security's real tight with rocket launchers, armed guard and even a helicopter ( does not fly )

let me know if there is any interest to actually play this..

stretch goals ->
adding twitch integration so maybe a live twitch stream and for every viewer,
ill spawn a new body to rush towards area 51, or maybe yall can trigger when to rush it.
